This example demonstrates an uncommon issue in Perl related to the iteration order of hashes.  Perl does not guarantee a specific order when iterating through the keys of a hash. The output may vary between different Perl versions and even on the same system with different runs. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your code relies on a specific key order.  The solution shows how to maintain order if needed, using a different data structure or a sorted keys approach.
